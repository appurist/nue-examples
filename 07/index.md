    Some text that DOES get rendered.

**If you don't see a header and footer, the layout.html file is getting ignored.**

This text, lower text on the main page, *is* rendered when the "div is" syntax is used,
but is not, when the header element is used.. Hmm.

*And hot-module reloading doesn't seem to work when something is commented out, but does when it is restored.*
