<div :is="header">My header</div>
<!-- <header>My header</header> -->

This text, lower text on the main page, *is* rendered when the "div is" syntax is used,
but is not, when the header element is used.. Hmm.

And hot-module reloading doesn't seem to work when something is commented out,
but does when it is restored.
